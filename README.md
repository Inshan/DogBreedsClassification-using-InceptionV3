There are a total of 70 different breeds of dog.

Dependencies include:
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. Numpy
6. OpenCV
7. OS

The project uses InceptionV3 (Transfer Learning) to correctly predict different dog-breeds. 
Though there is some loss, the model's accuracy is more than 85%.
