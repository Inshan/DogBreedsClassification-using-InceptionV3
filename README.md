#DogBreedsClassification-using-InceptionV3
It is a deep learning project done purely in python using Anaconda3-2021.11's jupyter notebook.

Data was extracted from kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set There are a total of 70 different breeds of dog.

Dependencies include:

Tensorflow
Keras
Matplotlib
Sklearn
Numpy
OpenCV
OS
The project uses InceptionV3 (Transfer Learning) to correctly predict different dog-breeds. Though there is some loss, the model's accuracy is more than 85%.
