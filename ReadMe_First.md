# DogBreedsClassification-using-InceptionV3

It is a deep learning project done purely in python using Anaconda3-2021.11's jupyter notebook.

Datasets were extracted from kaggle.
There are a total of 70 different breeds of dog. 
Training samples = 7946
Validation Samples = 700
Test Samples = 700

Dependencies include:
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. Numpy
6. OpenCV
7. OS

The project uses InceptionV3 (Transfer Learning) to correctly predict different dog-breeds.
Though there is some loss, the model's accuracy is more than 85%.
